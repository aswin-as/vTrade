      <div class="question">What is Futures and Options?</div>
      <div class="answer">Futures and options are financial derivatives used in markets to manage risk and provide opportunities for speculation. A futures contract obliges two parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date, offering a standardized approach to hedge against price fluctuations or engage in speculative trading. On the other hand, options contracts grant the holder the right, without the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a predetermined price within a specified timeframe. Options provide flexibility for investors, allowing them to benefit from price movements without directly owning the underlying asset. Both futures and options play crucial roles in financial markets, providing tools for risk management, hedging, and leveraging investment strategies.</div>
